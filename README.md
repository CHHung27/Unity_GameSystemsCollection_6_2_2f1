TMP Supported Rich Text Tags: https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.textmeshpro@4.0/manual/RichTextSupportedTags.html

TODO:
- CICD support
- Refactor DialogueManager to use file index when selecting file to play (maybe even get rid of FileManager)
- Add support for advancing dialogue on user input (on click, on button input)
- Add interface to allow user testing (enter custom test)
- better documentation (what setting to set TMP text, HTML tags usage, existence of in editor tools for asset creation)
- Maybe come up with a better name for DialogueManager
